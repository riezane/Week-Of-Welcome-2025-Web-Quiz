## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
- No server-side dependencies; the quiz runs entirely client-side using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Setup
1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   Alternatively, download the project as a ZIP file and extract it.

2. **Serve the Application**:
   - Open `index.html` directly in a web browser for local testing, or
   - Use a local development server (e.g., with Node.js or Python):
     ```bash
     # Using Python
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```
     Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

- **HTML**: The `index.html` file provides the structure for the quiz, including screens for welcome, name entry, quiz, results, game over, leaderboard, and about pages.
- **CSS**: Styles are split into modular files (e.g., `base.css`, `quiz.css`, `dark-mode.css`) for maintainability, with responsive design and dark/light mode support using CSS custom properties.
- **JavaScript**: Logic is divided into separate files (e.g., `quiz-logic.js`, `leaderboard.js`) handling game state, question rendering, timer, and leaderboard functionality. No external libraries are required.
- **Local Storage**: Leaderboard scores are saved using the browser's `localStorage` for persistence across sessions.
- **Randomization**: Questions are shuffled at the start of each game using the Fisher-Yates algorithm for a unique experience.
